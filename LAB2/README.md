# Logistic Regression Classifier

This Python script demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script using Python.
3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train a Logistic Regression classifier, and evaluate its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset used in this script can be found at the following URL:
