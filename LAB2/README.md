# Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier

This Python script demonstrates how to build and evaluate Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

You can install these libraries using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script using Python.
3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, and evaluate their performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset used in this script can be found at the following URL:

## Results

The script will print out the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for both Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
